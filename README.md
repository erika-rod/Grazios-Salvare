# Grazios-Salvare

## Introduction 
This repository contains the final dashboard code for the Grazioso Salvare Aninal Shelter Database Management System. The project was developed to provide an interface for managing animal data within a MongoDB database and supports core CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for streamlined data handling. 

## Reflection on Development and Problem-Solving
When developing programs, I aim for maintainable, readable, and adaptable code, essential for scalabale, efficient applications. Working on the CRUD Python module for Project One, I focused on modular design by creating well-defined functions for each database operation, making the code easier to understand and modify. This approach paid off in Project Two, where I used this module to link database operations with dashboard widgets, making integration seamless and reducing duplicate code. The structure of this module allows it to be reused in future projects or adapted for any application requiring CRUD functionality with MongoDB.

As a computer scientist, I approached Grazioso Salvare's database and dashboard requirements by breaking down the problem and analyzing each functionality request. The step-by-step breakdown allowed me to meet each specific client need while balancing database structure with efficient data retrieval. This project differed from other assignments because it required an interactive, data-driven interface, pushing me to integrate my backend database skills with front-end development. 

The role of a computer scientist is to develop innovative solutions that streamline operations and improve efficiency. Projects like this help organizations such as Grazioso Salvare by giving them tools to better manage their data, leading to more informed decisions, better resource management, and enhanced animal welfare efforts. Creating adaptable, user-focused solutions allows organizations to focus on their mission while ensuring their technologu evolves to support future needs.
